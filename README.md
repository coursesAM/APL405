## Course Content
This is an introductory course to statistical machine learning for students with some background in calculus, linear algebra and statistics. The course is focusing on supervised learning, i.e, classification and regression. The course will cover a range of methods used in machine learning and data science, including:
- Linear regression
- Classification via logistic regression and k nearest neighbour
- Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis
- Regression and classification trees
- Bagging and boosting
- Neural networks and deep learning

These methods will be studied from various applications throughout the course. The course also covers important practical considerations such as cross-validation, model selection and the bias-variance trade-off. The course includes theory (e.g., derivations and proofs) as well as practice (notably the lab and the course project). The practical part will be implemented using Python.

## Course Outline
This is the first course where deformation of solid bodies and the underlying concepts are introduced to undergraduate students. The course begins by building foundation of the concepts of stress and strain in three-dimensional deformable bodies. It further uses these concepts to study extension, torsion and bending of beams. The one-dimensional theory of beams are also introduced. Various theories of failure that are critical for design of machine elements in industry will also be discussed.

## Course Layout
- Mathematical preliminaries and notation; Concept of Traction vector; Concept of Stress tensor
- Stress tensor and its representation in Cartesian coordinate system; Transformation of stress matrix; Equations of equilibrium; Symmetry of stress tensor
- State of stress in simple cases; Principal stress components and principal planes; Maximizing shear component of traction; Mohrâ€™s circle
