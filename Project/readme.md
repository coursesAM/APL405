## Suggested Structure for the Report

The project must be chosen within the purview of civil, mechanical or material engineering sciences.

* Option A (Literature survey):
  * Introduction
    - What is the problem?
    - Why is it an important problem?
  * Survey
    - Summarize the range of techniques by highlighting their strengths and weaknesses (i.e., the 6-10 papers that you read)
    - Tip: this summary should not be a laundry list of techniques with an independent paragraph for each technique
    - Suggestion: organize your summary based on desirable properties of the techniques
  * Analysis
    - What is the state of the art?
    - Any open problem?
  * Conclusion
    - What have you learned?
    - What future research do you recommend?
    
* Option B (Empirical evaluation):
  * Introduction
    - What is the problem?
    - Why is it an important problem?
  * Techniques to tackle the problem
    - Brief review of previous work concerning this problem (i.e., the 3-6 papers that you read)
    - Brief description of the techniques chosen and why
  * Empirical evaluation
    - Compare empirically the techniques for complexity, performance, ease of use, etc.
  * Conclusion
    - What is the best technique?
    - Is any technique good enough to declare the problem solved?
    - What future research do you recommend?

* Option C (Algorithm design):
  * Introduction
    - What is the problem?
    - Why can't any of the existing techniques effectively tackle this problem?
    - What is the intuition behind the technique that you have developed?
  * Techniques to tackle the problem
    - Brief review of previous work concerning this problem (i.e., the 3-6 papers that you read)
    - Describe the technique that you developed
    - Brief description of the existing techniques that you will compare to
  * Evaluation
    - Analyze and compare (empirically or theoretically) your new approach to existing approaches
  * Conclusion
    - Can your new technique effectively tackle the problem?
    - What future research do you recommend?
